  <h2 id="introduction">Texas Sales Tax: Complex but Conquerable</h2>

  <p>Texas sales tax compliance can be one of the most challenging aspects of running a business in the Lone Star State. With over 1,000 taxing jurisdictions, varying rates, and strict penalty structures, getting it wrong can be expensive.</p>

  <p>But with the right knowledge and systems, Texas sales tax compliance doesn't have to be overwhelming. This guide covers everything small businesses need to know.</p>

  <h2 id="main-content">Understanding Texas Sales Tax Basics</h2>

  <h3>Current State Sales Tax Rate</h3>
  <p>Texas state sales tax rate is currently 6.25%. This base rate applies statewide, but local jurisdictions can add additional taxes.</p>

  <h3>Local Taxing Jurisdictions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Counties:</strong> Can impose up to 1% additional tax</li>
    <li><strong>Cities:</strong> Can impose up to 2% additional tax</li>
    <li><strong>Special Districts:</strong> Various additional taxes for specific purposes</li>
    <li><strong>Transportation Authorities:</strong> Additional taxes for transit</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Combined Rates by Location</h3>
  <p>Sales tax rates in Texas can range from 6.25% to 8.25% or higher depending on location. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Austin: 8.25% (6.25% state + 2% city)</li>
    <li>Dallas: 8.25% (6.25% state + 2% city)</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Economic Nexus and Registration Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>You have a physical presence in Texas (store, office, warehouse)</li>
    <li>You meet sales thresholds ($500,000+ in Texas sales annually)</li>
    <li>You meet transaction thresholds (200+ transactions in Texas annually)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Registration Requirements</h3>
  <p>If you have economic nexus, you must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Register with the Texas Comptroller</li>
