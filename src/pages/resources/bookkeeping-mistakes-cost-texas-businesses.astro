<h2 id="heading-0">The $10K Bookkeeping Tax</h2>

<p>Every Texas business owner I talk to thinks their bookkeeping is "fine." But when we dig into their numbers, we find mistakes that cost them $5,000 to $25,000 per year.</p>

<p>These aren't exotic errors. They're simple mistakes that happen because no one is watching the details. And they're completely preventable.</p>

<p>Here are the seven most common mistakes I see, and exactly how to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="heading-1">Mistake #1: Mixing Personal and Business Expenses</h2>

<h3 id="heading-2">The Cost: $2,000-5,000/year in lost deductions</h3>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Business owners use one bank account for everything. Personal groceries, business supplies, kids' soccer fees - it all gets mixed together.</p>

<p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You miss legitimate business deductions</li>
<li>IRS audits become more likely</li>
<li>You pay tax on personal expenses</li>
<li>Cash flow tracking becomes impossible</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-3">The Fix</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open separate accounts:</strong> Business checking, business credit card</li>
<li><strong>Set spending rules:</strong> Personal expenses never on business accounts</li>
<li><strong>Monthly review:</strong> Categorize every transaction</li>
<li><strong>Reimbursements:</strong> Pay yourself back for legitimate business expenses</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="heading-4">Texas Tip</h3>

<p>Texas has a 0.75% margin tax. Personal expenses mixed in can increase your margin tax liability by hundreds of dollars.</p>

<h2 id="heading-2">Mistake #2: Ignoring Petty Cash</h2>

<h3 id="heading-3">The Cost: $1,000-3,000/year in untracked spending</h3>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Small expenses like office supplies, coffee, parking - they add up but never get recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Real example:</strong> A client had $2,400 in unrecorded petty cash expenses over 12 months. They paid tax on money they didn't actually keep.</p>

<h3 id="heading-4">The Fix</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Digital receipts:</strong> Use Expensify or QuickBooks app for all purchases</li>
<li><strong>Weekly reconciliation:</strong> Review and categorize small expenses</li>
<li><strong>Monthly reports:</strong> Track petty cash trends</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-5">Mistake #3: Late Invoice Collection</h2>

<h3 id="heading-6">The Cost: $3,000-8,000/year in lost revenue</h3>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Invoices go out but payments trickle in 60-90 days later. Cash flow suffers, and you forget to follow up.</p>

<p><strong>Why it happens:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No systematic follow-up process</li>
<li>Embarrassment about asking for money</li>
<li>Poor invoice terms (net 60 instead of net 30)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-7">The Fix</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clear terms:</strong> Net 30 payment terms on all invoices</li>
<li><strong>Automated reminders:</strong> Use QuickBooks or Pilot for automatic follow-ups</li>
<li><strong>Payment incentives:</strong> 2% discount for payments within 10 days</li>
<li><strong>Late fees:</strong> 1.5% per month after due date</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-8">Mistake #4: Overpaying Vendors</h2>

<h3 id="heading-9">The Cost: $2,000-6,000/year in duplicate payments</h3>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Bills get paid twice. Happens more than you'd think.</p>

<p><strong>Common scenarios:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Paper checks and ACH payments for the same bill</li>
<li>Recurring payments that don't get canceled</li>
<li>Wire transfers that duplicate check payments</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-10">The Fix</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Three-way match:</strong> Invoice + Purchase Order + Receipt</li>
<li><strong>Payment calendar:</strong> Track all payments in one place</li>
<li><strong>Bank reconciliation:</strong> Monthly review of all transactions</li>
<li><strong>Vendor statements:</strong> Monthly reconciliation with suppliers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-11">Mistake #5: Missing Sales Tax</h2>

<h3 id="heading-12">The Cost: $1,000-4,000/year in penalties and interest</h3>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Texas sales tax is complicated. Different rates for different cities, exemptions you don't know about.</p>

<p><strong>Texas sales tax facts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>State rate: 6.25%</li>
<li>Local rates: 0.5% to 2% additional</li>
<li>Austin: 8.25% combined rate</li>
<li>Houston: 8.25% combined rate</li>
<li>Dallas: 8.25% combined rate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-13">The Fix</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tax automation:</strong> Use Stripe or Square for automatic collection</li>
<li><strong>Address validation:</strong> Confirm tax rates by delivery address</li>
<li><strong>Monthly filing:</strong> File sales tax returns on time</li>
<li><strong>Exemption certificates:</strong> Collect and track resale certificates</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-14">Mistake #6: Poor Inventory Tracking</h2>

<h3 id="heading-15">The Cost: $3,000-10,000/year in lost profits</h3>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> You don't know what you have, what it's worth, or what's selling.</p>

<p><strong>Real impact:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Stockouts cost sales opportunities</li>
<li>Overstocking ties up cash</li>
<li>Inaccurate cost of goods sold</li>
<li>Wrong inventory valuations on taxes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-16">The Fix</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Point of sale integration:</strong> Connect POS to accounting software</li>
<li><strong>Regular counts:</strong> Monthly physical inventory counts</li>
<li><strong>Cost tracking:</strong> FIFO or average cost methods</li>
<li><strong>Reorder points:</strong> Automated low-stock alerts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-17">Mistake #7: Ignoring Reconciliation</h2>

<h3 id="heading-18">The Cost: $5,000-15,000/year in undetected errors</h3>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Bank statements don't get reconciled monthly. Errors compound over time.</p>

<p><strong>What goes wrong:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Bank fees you don't notice</li>
<li>Duplicate transactions</li>
<li>Failed ACH payments</li>
<li>Fraudulent charges</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-19">The Fix</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly reconciliation:</strong> Every account, every month</li>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Use bank feeds to reduce manual work</li>
<li><strong>Review process:</strong> Someone different reviews each month</li>
<li><strong>Outstanding items:</strong> Follow up on uncleared transactions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-20">The Root Cause of These Mistakes</h2>

<p>These aren't random errors. They happen because:</p>

<h3 id="heading-21">1. No Dedicated Bookkeeper</h3>

<p>Business owners try to do it themselves or hand it off to an overworked admin. Bookkeeping requires specific skills and daily attention.</p>

<h3 id="heading-22">2. Poor Systems</h3>

<p>Using spreadsheets or outdated software that doesn't catch errors or automate processes.</p>

<h3 id="heading-23">3. No Accountability</h3>

<p>No one reviews the work or checks for mistakes. Errors go undetected for months or years.</p>

<h3 id="heading-24">4. Growth Without Process</h3>

<p>Businesses grow but their financial processes stay the same. What worked for $200K revenue doesn't work for $1M revenue.</p>

<h2 id="heading-26">The Solution: Professional Bookkeeping</h2>

<p>The only way to catch and prevent these mistakes is with dedicated bookkeeping attention. Here's what that looks like:</p>

<h3 id="heading-27">Monthly Bookkeeping Service</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reconciliation:</strong> All accounts reconciled monthly</li>
<li><strong>Review:</strong> Transaction categorization and error checking</li>
<li><strong>Reports:</strong> Profit & loss, balance sheet, cash flow</li>
<li><strong>Tax planning:</strong> Quarterly tax strategy reviews</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-28">Cost vs. Benefit</h3>

<p>A good bookkeeper costs $500-800/month. The mistakes they prevent are worth 5-10x that amount.</p>

<h2 id="heading-29">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Bookkeeping mistakes aren't just "accounting errors." They're profit leaks that compound over time.</p>

<p>The businesses that thrive are the ones that treat bookkeeping as a core business function, not an afterthought.</p>

<p>Stop losing money to preventable mistakes. Get your books audited, fix the errors, and put systems in place to prevent them from happening again.</p>

<p>Your bank account will thank you.</p>
