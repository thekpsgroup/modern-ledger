<h2 id="heading-0">The Tax Method That Costs You Money</h2>

<p>Most Texas business owners use the wrong accounting method. They're either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stuck in cash basis when they should be accrual</li>
<li>Using accrual when cash basis would save them money</li>
<li>Unsure which to use (most common)</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference isn't just "how you record transactions." It's about real money - thousands of dollars in tax savings or extra payments.</p>

<p>Let me show you exactly how to choose and when to switch.</p>

<h2 id="heading-1">Cash Basis: Simple But Limited</h2>

<h3 id="heading-2">How It Works</h3>

<p>You record income when you receive payment. You record expenses when you pay them.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You send an invoice in December but don't get paid until January. Under cash basis, you don't record the income until January.</p>

<h3 id="heading-3">Who Should Use Cash Basis</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Small service businesses</strong> under $25 million revenue</li>
<li><strong>Simple operations</strong> with few inventory items</li>
<li><strong>Businesses that want simplicity</strong> over precision</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-4">Tax Advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Defer income:</strong> Delay recognizing revenue by collecting payments later</li>
<li><strong>Accelerate deductions:</strong> Pay expenses early to reduce current year taxes</li>
<li><strong>Simple compliance:</strong> No complex adjustments needed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-2">Accrual Basis: Complex But Powerful</h2>

<h3 id="heading-3">How It Works</h3>

<p>You record income when you earn it (send invoice). You record expenses when you incur them (receive bill).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You send an invoice in December. Under accrual, you record the income in December, even if payment comes in January.</p>

<h3 id="heading-4">Who Must Use Accrual</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Public companies</strong> (required by law)</li>
<li><strong>Businesses over $25 million</strong> revenue (IRS requirement)</li>
<li><strong>Businesses with inventory</strong> (generally required)</li>
<li><strong>Any business that chooses it</strong> (with proper setup)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-5">Tax Advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Smooth income:</strong> Even revenue recognition prevents tax spikes</li>
<li><strong>Match expenses to revenue:</strong> Better profitability tracking</li>
<li><strong>Tax planning flexibility:</strong> More control over timing</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at real numbers for a Texas consulting business:</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Better (defer taxes)</td>
      <td>Worse (pay more now)</td>
      <td>$9,600 cash difference</td>

<h3 id="heading-8">When Cash Basis Saves You Money</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Growth years:</strong> Defer income to lower tax brackets</li>
<li><strong>High-expense years:</strong> Accelerate deductions</li>
<li><strong>Cash flow crunches:</strong> Delay tax payments</li>
<li><strong>Before selling:</strong> Minimize reported profits</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-9">When Accrual Basis Saves You Money</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Steady growth:</strong> Avoid tax bracket jumps</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal businesses:</strong> Smooth tax payments</li>
<li><strong>Inventory businesses:</strong> Match costs to sales</li>
<li><strong>Bank financing:</strong> Show consistent profits</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-10">How to Switch Accounting Methods</h2>

<h3 id="heading-11">From Cash to Accrual</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose your cutoff date:</strong> Usually year-end</li>
<li><strong>Calculate adjustments:</strong> Accrue unpaid invoices and bills</li>
<li><strong>File Form 3115:</strong> IRS permission to change methods</li>
<li><strong>Update your books:</strong> One-time adjustment entries</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tax Impact:</strong> May create additional taxable income in the transition year.</p>

<h3 id="heading-12">From Accrual to Cash</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reverse accruals:</strong> Eliminate unpaid invoices and bills</li>
<li><strong>IRS approval:</strong> Form 3115 required</li>
<li><strong>One-time adjustment:</strong> Reduce taxable income</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tax Impact:</strong> Usually creates a tax loss in the transition year.</p>

<h3 id="heading-13">The Automatic Change Rule</h3>

<p>If your average revenue is under $25 million for 3+ years, you can change methods without IRS permission. But you still need to file Form 3115.</p>

<h2 id="heading-14">Texas-Specific Tax Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="heading-15">Texas Margin Tax</h3>

<p>Texas has a 0.75% margin tax that follows federal accounting methods. Your choice affects both federal and state taxes.</p>

<h3 id="heading-16">Sales Tax Timing</h3>

<p>If you collect sales tax, accrual basis requires tracking it when earned, not when collected. This can create temporary differences between your books and tax payments.</p>

<h3 id="heading-17">Oil & Gas Considerations</h3>

<p>Texas energy businesses often use accrual for percentage depletion and complex revenue recognition rules.</p>

<h2 id="heading-18">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<h3 id="heading-19">Mixing Methods</h3>

<p>Some businesses try to "pick and choose" - using accrual for expenses but cash for income. The IRS calls this "hybrid method" and it's generally not allowed without specific approval.</p>

<h3 id="heading-20">Ignoring Inventory Rules</h3>

<p>If you have inventory, you generally must use accrual basis. Cash basis inventory tracking leads to inaccurate cost of goods sold.</p>

<h3 id="heading-21">Late Changes</h3>

<p>Changing methods mid-year requires IRS permission and can be complicated. Plan changes at year-end.</p>

<h2 id="heading-22">Which Method is Right for You?</h2>

<h3 id="heading-23">Choose Cash Basis If:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your revenue is under $5 million</li>
<li>You have simple operations</li>
<li>You want maximum tax deferral</li>
<li>Cash flow management is critical</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-24">Choose Accrual Basis If:</h3>

<ul>
<li>You have inventory</li>
<li>Your revenue exceeds $10 million</li>
<li>You want smooth tax payments</li>
<li>You need accurate financial statements for loans</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-25">The Hybrid Approach</h3>

<p>Some businesses use accrual for financial reporting but cash for tax purposes. This requires careful tracking and IRS approval.</p>

<h2 id="heading-26">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The right accounting method saves you money by matching your business needs with tax opportunities. Cash basis gives you control over timing. Accrual basis gives you accuracy and consistency.</p>

<p>Most Texas businesses should start with cash basis and switch to accrual when they hit $5-10 million in revenue or add inventory.</p>

<p>The key is understanding both methods and choosing based on your specific situation, not following what "everyone else does."</p>
