<h2 id="heading-0">The Accounting Method That Costs You $10K</h2>

<p>Most Texas business owners use the wrong accounting method. They're either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stuck in cash basis when accrual would save them money</li>
<li>Using accrual when cash basis would reduce their taxes</li>
<li>Unsure which to use (this is most people)</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference isn't just "how you record stuff." It's real money - thousands of dollars in tax savings or extra payments every year.</p>

<p>Let me show you exactly how to choose and when to switch.</p>

<h2 id="heading-1">Cash Basis Accounting: Simple But Powerful</h2>

<h3 id="heading-2">How It Works</h3>

<p>You record revenue when you receive payment. You record expenses when you pay them.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You send an invoice in December but get paid in January. Under cash basis, you don't record the revenue until January.</p>

<h3 id="heading-3">Who Can Use Cash Basis</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Small businesses:</strong> Under $25 million average revenue</li>
<li><strong>Simple operations:</strong> Few inventory items</li>
<li><strong>Service businesses:</strong> Consulting, professional services</li>
<li><strong>Most Texas small businesses</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-4">Tax Advantages in Texas</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Defer income:</strong> Delay recognizing revenue to lower tax brackets</li>
<li><strong>Accelerate deductions:</strong> Pay expenses early to reduce current taxes</li>
<li><strong>Tax planning:</strong> Time income and expenses for optimal tax outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Cash flow control:</strong> Better matching of tax payments to cash availability</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-2">Accrual Basis Accounting: Complex But Precise</h2>

<h3 id="heading-3">How It Works</h3>

<p>You record revenue when you earn it (send invoice). You record expenses when you incur them (receive bill).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You send an invoice in December. Under accrual, you record the revenue in December, even if payment comes in January.</p>

<h3 id="heading-4">Who Must Use Accrual</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Large businesses:</strong> Over $25 million average revenue</li>
<li><strong>Public companies:</strong> Required by law</li>
<li><strong>Inventory businesses:</strong> Required for accurate cost tracking</li>
<li><strong>C-Corporations:</strong> Generally required</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-5">Tax Advantages</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Smooth income:</strong> Avoid tax bracket jumps from lumpy revenue</li>
<li><strong>Accurate matching:</strong> Expenses match revenue periods</li>
<li><strong>Inventory tracking:</strong> Proper cost of goods sold calculation</li>
<li><strong>Loan qualification:</strong> More accurate financial statements</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-9">When Cash Basis Saves You Money</h2>

<h3 id="heading-10">Growth Years</h3>

<p>Defer income to stay in lower tax brackets. Perfect for businesses growing from $200K to $500K revenue.</p>

<h3 id="heading-11">High-Expense Years</h3>

<p>Accelerate deductions by paying expenses early. Buy equipment in December instead of January.</p>

<h3 id="heading-12">Cash Flow Management</h3>

<p>Delay tax payments when cash is tight. Better for businesses with seasonal revenue patterns.</p>

<h3 id="heading-13">Before Major Changes</h3>

<p>Minimize reported profits before selling the business or bringing in investors.</p>

<h2 id="heading-14">When Accrual Basis Saves You Money</h2>

<h3 id="heading-15">Steady Growth</h3>

<p>Avoid tax bracket jumps from lumpy project-based revenue.</p>

<h3 id="heading-16">Seasonal Businesses</h3>

<p>Smooth tax payments throughout the year instead of big payments during busy seasons.</p>

<h3 id="heading-17">Inventory Businesses</h3>

<p>Accurate cost of goods sold prevents overpaying taxes on inventory profits.</p>

<h3 id="heading-18">Bank Financing</h3>

<p>More accurate financial statements make it easier to get loans and better terms.</p>

<h2 id="heading-19">How to Switch Accounting Methods</h2>

<h3 id="heading-20">From Cash to Accrual</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose cutoff date:</strong> Usually December 31</li>
<li><strong>Calculate adjustments:</strong> Accrue unpaid invoices and bills</li>
<li><strong>File Form 3115:</strong> Get IRS permission</li>
<li><strong>Update books:</strong> One-time adjustment entries</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tax impact:</strong> May increase taxable income in transition year</p>

<h3 id="heading-21">From Accrual to Cash</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reverse accruals:</strong> Eliminate unpaid invoices and bills</li>
<li><strong>IRS approval:</strong> Form 3115 required</li>
<li><strong>One-time adjustment:</strong> Usually creates tax loss</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tax impact:</strong> Often reduces taxable income in transition year</p>

<h3 id="heading-22">The Automatic Change Rule</h3>

<p>If your average revenue is under $25 million for 3+ consecutive years, you can change methods without IRS permission. Still need to file Form 3115.</p>

<h2 id="heading-23">Texas-Specific Tax Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="heading-24">Texas Margin Tax</h3>

<p>Texas margin tax (0.75%) follows your federal accounting method. Your choice affects both federal and state taxes.</p>

<h3 id="heading-25">Sales Tax Timing</h3>

<p>If you collect sales tax:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cash basis:</strong> Record sales tax when collected</li>
<li><strong>Accrual basis:</strong> Record sales tax when earned</li>
</ul>

<p>This can create temporary differences between your books and tax payments.</p>

<h3 id="heading-26">Property Tax</h3>

<p>Business property taxes are accrued, regardless of your method. This affects businesses with significant fixed assets.</p>

<h2 id="heading-27">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<h3 id="heading-28">Hybrid Methods</h3>

<p>Some businesses try to "pick and choose" - accrual for expenses but cash for income. The IRS calls this "hybrid method" and it's generally not allowed without specific approval.</p>

<h3 id="heading-29">Ignoring Inventory Rules</h3>

<p>If you have inventory, you generally must use accrual basis. Cash basis inventory tracking leads to inaccurate cost of goods sold and tax overpayments.</p>

<h3 id="heading-30">Late Changes</h3>

<p>Changing methods mid-year requires IRS permission and can be complicated. Plan changes for year-end.</p>

<h3 id="heading-31">Not Considering State Taxes</h3>

<p>Texas follows federal accounting methods for margin tax. Your choice affects both federal and state tax calculations.</p>

<h2 id="heading-32">Which Method is Right for Your Texas Business?</h2>

<h3 id="heading-33">Choose Cash Basis If:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Revenue under $5 million</li>
<li>Simple operations, no inventory</li>
<li>You want maximum tax deferral</li>
<li>Cash flow management is critical</li>
<li>You're in a growth phase</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-34">Choose Accrual Basis If:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Revenue over $10 million</li>
<li>You have significant inventory</li>
<li>You want smooth tax payments</li>
<li>You need accurate financial statements for loans</li>
<li>You're a C-Corporation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-35">The Hybrid Approach</h3>

<p>Some businesses use accrual for financial reporting but cash for tax purposes. This requires careful tracking and IRS approval for "book-tax differences."</p>

<h2 id="heading-36">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The right accounting method saves you thousands in taxes while matching your business needs. Cash basis gives you control over timing. Accrual basis gives you accuracy and consistency.</p>

<p>Most Texas businesses should start with cash basis and switch to accrual when they hit $5-10 million in revenue or add significant inventory.</p>

<p>The key is understanding both methods and choosing based on your specific situation, not following what "everyone else does."</p>

<p>Get professional advice before making changes - the tax savings can be substantial, but the rules are complex.</p>
