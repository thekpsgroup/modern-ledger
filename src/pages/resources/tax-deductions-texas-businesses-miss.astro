<h2 id="heading-0">The $15K Tax Deduction Problem</h2>

<p>Every year, Texas businesses leave an average of $15,000 in tax deductions on the table. These aren't obscure loopholes. They're legitimate deductions that most CPA firms either forget to mention or don't know about.</p>

<p>After reviewing hundreds of Texas tax returns, I've found the same missed deductions over and over. Here are the ten most common, with real examples from Texas businesses.</p>

<h2 id="heading-1">1. Qualified Business Income Deduction (QBI)</h2>

<h3 id="heading-2">Potential Savings: $5,000-15,000/year</h3>

<p><strong>What it is:</strong> 20% deduction on qualified business income for pass-through entities (sole proprietors, partnerships, S-corps).</p>

<p><strong>Who qualifies:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sole proprietors</li>
<li>LLC owners (disregarded entities)</li>
<li>Partnerships</li>
<li>S-Corporations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Texas example:</strong> A Dallas consulting firm with $200K net income gets $40K QBI deduction, dropping their taxable income to $160K.</p>

<h3 id="heading-3">Common Miss:</h3>

<p>Businesses with income over $200K think they don't qualify. But the deduction phases out gradually, not all at once.</p>

<h2 id="heading-2">2. Research & Development Tax Credit</h2>

<h3 id="heading-3">Potential Savings: $3,000-25,000/year</h3>

<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Federal R&D credit for developing new products, processes, or software.</p>

<p><strong>Texas businesses that qualify:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Software development companies</li>
<li>Manufacturing firms improving processes</li>
<li>Tech startups</li>
<li>Engineering firms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real example:</strong> An Austin software company spent $50K on R&D and got $12K credit + deduction.</p>

<h3 id="heading-4">Texas Bonus:</h3>

<p>Texas offers additional R&D incentives through the Texas Enterprise Fund and Skills Development Fund.</p>

<h2 id="heading-5">3. Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)</h2>

<h3 id="heading-6">Potential Savings: $2,400-9,600 per hire</h3>

<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Tax credit for hiring from targeted groups (veterans, long-term unemployed, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Credit amounts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>$2,400 for veterans</li>
<li>$2,400 for long-term unemployed (27+ weeks)</li>
<li>$4,800 for SNAP recipients</li>
<li>$9,600 for certain disabled veterans</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Texas example:</strong> A Houston construction company hired 3 veterans and got $7,200 credit.</p>

<h3 id="heading-7">Pro Tip:</h3>

<p>Credit applies to wages paid in first year. Must complete Form 8850 within 28 days of hire.</p>

<h2 id="heading-8">4. Qualified Improvement Property</h2>

<h3 id="heading-9">Potential Savings: $10,000-50,000 deduction</h3>

<p><strong>What it is:</strong> 100% bonus depreciation for building improvements (not just equipment).</p>

<p><strong>Qualifying improvements:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>HVAC systems</li>
<li>Roofing</li>
<li>Electrical systems</li>
<li>Plumbing</li>
<li>Fire suppression</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Texas example:</strong> A San Antonio retail store spent $40K on HVAC and got full $40K deduction in year 1.</p>

<h3 id="heading-10">Important:</h3>

<p>This is temporary - expires December 31, 2025. Act now for 2024 improvements.</p>

<h2 id="heading-11">5. Vehicle Deductions (Actual Expenses)</h2>

<h3 id="heading-12">Potential Savings: $2,000-8,000/year</h3>

<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Deduct actual vehicle expenses instead of standard mileage rate.</p>

<p><strong>When it pays off:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You drive more than 50% for business</li>
<li>You have expensive vehicles</li>
<li>You keep detailed logs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Texas example:</strong> A sales rep with $15K in actual expenses (gas, maintenance, insurance) vs $7K standard mileage deduction.</p>

<h3 id="heading-13">Required:</h3>

<p>Detailed mileage logs and expense records. Use apps like MileIQ or Everlance.</p>

<h2 id="heading-14">6. Home Office Deduction</h2>

<h3 id="heading-15">Potential Savings: $1,500-5,000/year</h3>

<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Deduct portion of home expenses for dedicated office space.</p>

<p><strong>Qualification:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Exclusive and regular use</li>
<li>Principal place of business OR</li>
<li>Space used for administrative work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Texas example:</strong> A consultant with 200 sq ft home office in 2,000 sq ft home deducts 10% of utilities, insurance, etc.</p>

<h3 id="heading-16">Simplified Method:</h3>

<p>$5 per square foot up to 300 sq ft ($1,500 max). No need for detailed records.</p>

<h2 id="heading-17">7. Startup Costs</h2>

<h3 id="heading-18">Potential Savings: $5,000-10,000 deduction</h3>

<ul>
<li>Incorporation fees</li>
<li>Legal fees</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Market research</li>
<li>Employee training</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Texas example:</strong> A new e-commerce business with $12K startup costs deducts $5K immediately + $1K/year for 7 years.</p>

<h3 id="heading-19">Bonus:</h3>

<p>Organizational costs (LLC formation, etc.) also qualify for same treatment.</p>

<h2 id="heading-20">8. Section 179 Deduction</h2>

<h3 id="heading-21">Potential Savings: $10,000-500,000 deduction</h3>

<h3 id="heading-22">Timing Matters:</h3>

<p>Equipment must be placed in service by December 31. Order now, install later if needed.</p>

<h2 id="heading-23">9. Health Insurance Deduction</h2>

</ul>

<h3 id="heading-25">Important:</h3>

<p>Deduction is taken on personal return (Form 1040), not business return.</p>

<h2 id="heading-26">10. Energy Efficient Improvements</h2>

<h2 id="heading-29">Why Texas Businesses Miss These Deductions</h2>

<h3 id="heading-30">1. CPA Firms Don't Specialize</h3>

<p>Most CPA firms handle compliance but not tax planning. They file returns but don't hunt for deductions.</p>

<h3 id="heading-31">2. Timing Matters</h3>

<p>Many deductions require year-end planning. Waiting until tax season means missed opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="heading-32">3. Complex Rules</h3>

<p>Deductions like R&D credit require specific documentation and calculations that generalists avoid.</p>

<h3 id="heading-33">4. Low Awareness</h3>

<p>Business owners don't know what they don't know. They assume their CPA is finding everything.</p>

<h2 id="heading-34">How to Find Your Missed Deductions</h2>

<h3 id="heading-35">Year-End Tax Planning</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Review last 3 years:</strong> Compare returns for missed items</li>
<li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Keep receipts and records</li>
<li><strong>Consult specialists:</strong> Tax planning vs. compliance CPAs</li>
<li><strong>Timing optimization:</strong> Accelerate deductions, defer income</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="heading-36">Texas-Specific Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Texas Enterprise Fund:</strong> Additional incentives</li>
<li><strong>Skills Development Fund:</strong> Training tax credits</li>
<li><strong>EZ/ECZ incentives:</strong> Enterprise zones offer tax abatements</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="heading-37">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Tax deductions aren't found - they're hunted. The businesses that save the most are the ones that plan year-round and work with tax specialists.</p>

<p>Don't wait until April 15 to think about taxes. Start planning now for 2024 deductions and set yourself up for 2025 savings.</p>

<p>The difference between a good tax return and a great one is often $10,000-20,000 in found deductions.</p>

<p>Your CPA should be finding these for you. If they're not, it's time to find one who will.</p>
